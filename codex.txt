Please read the chemfetch-backend-live\test-data\README.md. Can you please run the test and get the chemfetch-backend-live\ocr_service\sds_parser_new\sds_extractor.py or chemfetch-backend-live\ocr_service\parse_sds.py and see how the parsing performs? It is not extracting sds_4 with any  details, as it is a scanned pdf doc. The sample sds pdf files are in chemfetch-backend-live\test-data\sds-pdfs and the test results are in chemfetch-backend-live\test-data\sds_test_results.json. Run the test, check the results compared to the sample pdf and fix the code and test again, rinse and repeat until fully working and the parsed data totally matches with the sample pdf files. You will manually cheek them yourself. Do not manually modify chemfetch-backend-live\test-data\sds_test_results.json. Also you can't create cheat code, for example if a products name is ArmorAll you cant't create code that specifically searches a pdf for ArmorAll or anything like that and if there is somethng like that in the code please remove it.
