# ChemFetch Backend Deployment Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. ES Modules vs CommonJS Issue ✅ FIXED

- **Error**: `ReferenceError: require is not defined` in `app.js` line 63
- **Cause**: Using `require()` in ES modules context (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- **Fix**: Changed dynamic `require()` to static import in `server/app.ts`

### 2. Puppeteer Chrome Installation ✅ FIXED

- **Error**: `Could not find Chrome (ver. 139.0.7258.138)`
- **Cause**: Chrome not installed during Render build process
- **Fix**: Added `npx puppeteer browsers install chrome` to buildCommand in `render.yaml`

### 3. Other Issues Identified:

#### Google Search API Configuration

- API key is not configured (`GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY` missing)
- Falling back to Bing search via Puppeteer
- This is working as intended (fallback mechanism)

#### OCR Service

- OCR service URLs are properly configured
- Fallback mechanisms are in place

## Next Steps:

1. **Rebuild TypeScript**: Run `npm run build` to generate updated JS files
2. **Deploy to Render**: Push changes to trigger new deployment
3. **Monitor logs**: Check for successful startup without the `require` error

## Commands to run:

```bash
# In chemfetch-backend-live directory
npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "Fix ES modules require error and add Chrome installation"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Results:

- No more "require is not defined" errors
- Successful Chrome installation during build
- Puppeteer-based scraping working properly
- Parse-SDS route loading successfully
