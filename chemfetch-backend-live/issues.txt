Below are issues I have pointed with the sds parser. I will show the actual data versus the data the parser extracted, I will also add comment if needed.
Also the sample pfd files are in chemfetch-backend-live\test-data\sds-pdfs. The test results are generated in chemfetch-backend-live\test-data
if you want to check them, and also a README.md. I would like you to look at the files and the results I am having issues with fist before improving the code.
Make any changes required to fix the code. Please do not remove any working code and do not brake any existing code
